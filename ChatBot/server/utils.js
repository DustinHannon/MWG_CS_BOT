    Bot: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what happened?
    Customer: I went to my doctor for treatment, and they would not take my insurance.
    Bot: Okay, I can look up your doctor by name to see if they are in our covered network or not.
    Bot: I see that the doctor you used is not in our network.
    Bot: Unfortunately, this means that your insurance would not cover this doctor's visit.
    Customer: Thank you!
